### Description

This is an archive of CSC1001 (2022 Fall) course assignments.

`CSC1001 - Introduction to Computer Science: Programming Methodology` is an introductory course at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, a.k.a. CUHK(SZ), for beginners to learn programming. In this course, our primary programming language is **Python 3**.

In the 2022 Fall semester, there were **four** assignments for practicing. I've uploaded all the problems and my solutions to them.

|  Assignment  | Number of Problems |
| :----------: | :----------------: |
| Assignment 1 |        $6$         |
| Assignment 2 |        $6$         |
| Assignment 3 |        $3$         |
| Assignment 4 |        $3$         |

### Acknowledgment

These assignments are designed carefully by the professors in CUHK(SZ).

Please kindly note that there are some restrictions if you want to use this archive.

* You are allowed to download, read, modify, or share my solutions (programs) freely. The solutions are named in the format of `q$.py` where `$` can be replaced by the problem id.
* You are allowed to download or read the problem statements freely. The problem statements are named in the format of `Assignment $` where `$` can be replaced by the assignment id.
* You are **NOT** allowed to modify, copy, or share the problem statements without permission from the professors who taught this course in CUHK(SZ).
* CUHK(SZ) students who enrolled in this course but did not submit these assignments are **NOT** allowed to download, read, copy, modify, or share **any** materials (including problem statements and my solution) in this archive. **ACADEMIC HONESTY DOES MATTER**.

### Remarks

The Python programs do **NOT** follow the PEP 8 standard.

The problems are elementary, but I implemented an interesting algorithm in Problem 6, Assignment 2. I use the X algorithm on Dancing Links to solve the Eight Queens Problem.
